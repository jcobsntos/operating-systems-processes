# 🖥️ Operating Systems — Process Scheduling & Page Replacement

This repository contains my laboratory exercises on **Operating Systems** 🧵, focusing on process scheduling and memory management algorithms.  
These implementations showcase core OS concepts such as **CPU scheduling** and **page replacement**, written for educational purposes.

## 📂 Activities

### ⏳ FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
Implements the **First-Come, First-Served** CPU scheduling algorithm.  
📝 *Processes are scheduled in the order they arrive, demonstrating non-preemptive scheduling.*

---

### 📄 FIFO Page Replacement
Implements the **First-In, First-Out (FIFO)** page replacement algorithm.  
🗃️ *Oldest pages in memory are replaced first when a page fault occurs.*

---

### 🔄 LRU Page Replacement
Implements the **Least Recently Used (LRU)** page replacement algorithm.  
🧹 *Replaces the page that has not been used for the longest period of time.*

---

### 📈 Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm
Implements the **Optimal** page replacement algorithm.  
🔍 *Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future — the theoretical best case.*
